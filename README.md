# greasemonkey-stuff
This repo mainly consists of various scripts that help me to stay sane.

Some websites decide to be tedious and annoy users. I don't like that so here are some scripts.

## Requirements
* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/)
* [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)

## Installation
Just create a new userscript and paste the code.
The scripts are selfcontained and do not need namespacing and other meta data on the script formular.
